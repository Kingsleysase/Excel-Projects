## Introduction

This project explores a pizza business’s sales and customer behavior using Excel. From nearly 50,000 pizzas sold and over $800,000 in revenue, I used data to uncover insights about what works, what doesn’t, and what can be improved. It’s more than just analysis, it’s about understanding the business story hidden in the numbers.

## Business Problem / Context

The pizza shop is growing, but decision-makers want to know:
- What times are the busiest?
- Which pizzas sell best?
- Are we pricing well?
- What do customers prefer?

To keep improving, they needed answers based on real data, not guesswork.

---

## Objective of the Project

- Understand **sales patterns** (hourly, daily).
- Identify **top-selling pizzas** and best-performing sizes.
- Analyze **customer preferences** (veg vs non-veg, one vs multiple pizzas).
- Find out which products bring the most **revenue**.
- Recommend ways to improve **sales, satisfaction**, and **profitability**.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Data Cleaning (text functions, filters, sort)
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Pivot Tables
  - Pivot Charts
  - Formulas (AVERAGEIFS, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS)
  - Dashboard creation

---

## Project Scope

- The entire project was done using just **Microsoft Excel**
- Focused on **descriptive analysis** no predictive modeling
- Delivered as a clean, professional dashboard with clear insights

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- I removed blanks, fixed incorrect entries
- I standardized date and time formats
- I extracted new columns for Hour and Day
- I converted fields to numeric/text formats where required  
- I also filtered invalid/outlier values  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- I found the **busiest hours**: 12 PM – 1 PM and 5 PM – 7 PM
- I found the **busiest days**: Friday (most orders), followed by Saturday and Thursday
- I identified that **Large Pizzas** dominate sales and revenue
- I noticed that classic pizzas are the most popular by orders and revenue
- I also saw that 98% of customers order just one pizza per transaction
- Non-vegetarian pizzas are more popular than vegetarian ones

---

## Data Visualization & Dashboarding

Two full Excel dashboards were created with visuals for:
- Hourly and daily sales
- Category and size performance
- Revenue by pizza type
- Customer ordering behavior
- Pizza preference breakdown, etc

---

## Insights & Interpretation

- **Large Pizzas** are the most profitable — customers prefer bigger sizes
- **Classic Deluxe Pizza** is the top-selling product (2,416 orders)
- **Thai Chicken, Barbecue Chicken**, and **California Chicken** bring in the most revenue (~$43K each)
- Most customers **order alone** — a big opportunity to upsell bundles
- **Vegetarian pizzas** are under-marketed despite 11,449 orders — potential for growth
- Peak hours = **Lunch and Dinner Rush** — marketing should focus here

---

## Recommendations
I recommend that the business should:
1. **Promote top-selling days** like Friday, with special offers or loyalty programs.
2. **Offer meal bundles** or family packs to increase multiple pizza orders.
3. **Introduce creative vegetarian options** to serve a growing health-conscious audience.
4. **Double down on large sizes** — they dominate sales, so keep them well-stocked and well-made.
5. **Try breakfast pizza options or weekend brunch menus** to increase sales during slow hours (morning, Sundays).

---

## Conclusion

This Excel-based pizza sales analysis shows how simple tools can deliver strong business results. From pricing strategy to customer behavior, the project uncovered ways to improve service and profitability using data storytelling.

The business generated $817,860 in revenue, and this analysis helps explain *how* and *why*. It’s a reminder that **every pizza ordered is more than a slice — it’s a signal**. And data, when used right, helps you turn those signals into smarter decisions.

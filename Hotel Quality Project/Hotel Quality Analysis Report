## Introduction
This project explores patterns in hotel bookings using Excel, uncovering how ratings, booking prices, room types, seasons, and customer behavior affect hotel performance and profitability. It's a practical demonstration of how data analytics can support better decisions in the hospitality industry.

---

## Business Problem / Context
Hotels face the challenge of balancing customer satisfaction with profitability. Despite high ratings, some hotels operate on slim profit margins. This analysis investigates the relationship between ratings, prices, discount strategies, room types, and payment methods to uncover actionable patterns that can drive business performance.

---

## Objective of the Project
To analyze hotel booking data to:
- Uncover insights related to hotel quality, guest satisfaction, and financial performance.
- Discover what influences hotel ratings.
- Explore the financial trade-offs between high ratings and profit margins.
- Identify seasonal and behavioral trends in bookings.
- Recommend strategic actions to improve service and profitability.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains:
- Hotel ratings  
- Booking prices  
- Profit margins  
- Room types  
- Discounts  
- Payment methods  
- Duration of stay  
- Month of booking  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**  
  - Data cleaning  
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Pivot tables  
  - Charts and dashboards  
  - Excel formulas (AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS, VLOOKUP, etc.)

---

## Project Scope
This project:
- Focuses on analyzing hotel quality metrics and financial outcomes
- Used **Excel only** for the entire data pipeline
- Provides visual dashboards and a recommendation report

---

## Data Collection & Integration
The dataset was pre-collected and uploaded into Excel, simulating real-world hotel booking scenarios.

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
I chose Excel to clean the data because it's easy to use, and the dataset is not large. The following steps were performed:

- I sorted and filtered the data to remove unnecessary and inaccurate data (Outlier values).
- I handled missing and duplicate entries  
- I standardized payment types and date entries
- I removed duplicates and blank cells to ensure the remaining data is usable.
- I fixed rows and columns by verifying that columns with numbers were all numbers by converting text in some cells into numbers.
- I ensured that each field had the appropriate data type by performing any conversions that were needed.

The raw data was transformed and changed into a standard data format suitable for analysis, storage, and easy use.

---

## Key Questions
- What factors influence hotel ratings most significantly?
- Do higher-rated hotels earn more or less profit per booking?
- Is there a strong relationship between discounts and customer ratings?
- Which room types are most associated with guest satisfaction?
- Are there seasonal patterns in ratings â€” which months perform best or worst?
- Do payment methods correlate with higher/lower guest ratings?
- Does booking price vary significantly between higher-rated and lower-rated hotels?
- Do guests tend to stay longer in highly rated hotels?

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Reveal drivers of hotel rating variations  
- Show the impact of quality on financial performance  
- Identify seasonality trends and room type preferences  
- Provide visualizations for business decision-making  
- Generate practical recommendations for hotel improvement  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- I calculated the overall average hotel ratings  
- I identified the highest and lowest performing hotels  
- I correlated hotel ratings with prices, discounts, and profit margins  
- I segmented data by room type, payment method, and rating tier  
- I analyzed trends over booking months  

---

## Data Visualization & Dashboarding
I developed two Excel dashboards to visualize:
- Monthly trends in hotel ratings  
- Relationship between rating and profit margin  
- Room type performance  
- Payment method distribution  
- Booking price variations across rating groups  

---
## Insights & Interpretation

### Key Takeaways:
- Higher-rated hotels (4.5â€“4.7) charge **double** the price of lower-rated hotels, yet have **lower profit margins**
- **Seasonal trends** affect ratings â€” January, March, May, and October see better satisfaction scores  
- **Double and Single Rooms** earn higher ratings; larger room types often underperform  
- Discounts do **not strongly impact ratings** (weak correlation ~0.22)  
- Guests paying via **Internet Banking** leave higher ratings  
- Guests do **not stay significantly longer** in higher-rated hotels  

---

## Recommendations
I recommend that the hotel should:
- Promote **Double and Single Rooms** more, as guests seem to like them the most.  
- Improve the quality of service all year round, not just in certain months.  
- Find a better balance between giving good service and making enough profit.  
- Give **special treatment** or offers to guests who stay for just a few days.  
- Encourage customers to use **Internet Banking**, as itâ€™s linked to better guest ratings.

---

## Conclusion
This Excel-powered project highlights how simple tools, when used strategically, can uncover meaningful business insights. By connecting customer satisfaction, pricing strategy, and operational efficiency, this analysis empowers hotel decision-makers to take more informed actions.

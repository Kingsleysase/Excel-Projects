## 1. Introduction & Business Context

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of U.S. furniture sales data to uncover trends, performance gaps, and growth opportunities. The furniture retail industry often struggles with seasonal fluctuations, logistical inefficiencies, and inconsistent regional performance. Without proper analytics, optimizing inventory, logistics, and marketing becomes a guessing game. My goal was to solve this by transforming transactional data into a compelling, decision-ready Excel dashboard.

## 4. Data Analysis & Visualization

I developed a sleek, multi-section Excel dashboard with the following components:

- ** KPI Cards**: Total sales ($742K), profit ($18.5K), quantity (8.0K), with YoY growth  
- ** Monthly Trend Chart**: Peak in December ($121.8K), showing seasonal spikes  
- ** Geographic Heatmap**: NYC led with $75.7K in sales  
- ** Shipping Analysis**: Standard Class dominated (59% usage), 28% delivered in <4 days  
- ** Product Breakdown**: Chairs alone accounted for $328.4K (44% of sales)

## 5. Key Insights & Findings

### Performance Highlights
- 8% YoY sales growth and 11% increase in quantity sold  
- December saw sales **127% above average**, confirming a strong Q4 trend  
- **28% of orders delivered within 4 days**, showing logistics efficiency  
- Sales are heavily concentrated in major coastal cities  
- Chairs emerged as the top-selling product (44% share)  
- Customers prefer **Standard Class shipping** for its balance of cost and delivery time  

### Critical Observations

## 6. Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0–6 months)
1. **Q4 Readiness**: Ramp up inventory and marketing **2–3 months before December**  
2. **Geo Expansion**: Launch campaigns in **underpenetrated Central & Southern states**  
3. **Logistics Strategy**: Maintain Standard Class focus, **test premium shipping** options  

### Long-Term Strategy (6–18 months)
4. **Product Development**: Build on Chairs’ success by introducing accessories & bundles  
5. **Customer Retention**: Design **post-holiday campaigns** to retain peak season buyers  
6. **Market Diversification**: Reduce reliance on East/West coasts by exploring **secondary regions**

### Recommendations
## Strategic Actions:

- Seasonal Planning: Increase inventory and marketing investment ahead of Q4 peak
- Geographic Expansion: Explore opportunities in the underserved central states
- Shipping Optimization: Maintain Standard Class focus while improving delivery speed
- Product Strategy: Leverage chair category success to drive cross-selling

### Conclusion
This analysis successfully transformed complex sales data into clear, actionable insights through Excel's powerful analytics capabilities. The dashboard provides stakeholders with real-time visibility into business performance while highlighting strategic opportunities for growth. The combination of seasonal awareness, geographic insights, and operational efficiency metrics positions the business for informed decision-making and sustainable growth.
The project demonstrates that sophisticated business analytics can be achieved using familiar tools, such as Excel, making insights accessible to all stakeholders, regardless of their technical expertise.

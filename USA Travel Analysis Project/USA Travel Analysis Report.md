## Introduction

I analyzed over 31 years of U.S. international travel data covering 46 destinations to understand where Americans travel, when they travel, and what trends exist. As someone who loves data storytelling, I wanted to dig into the numbers and uncover patterns that tourism stakeholders can act on.

---

## Business Problem / Context

The travel industry relies heavily on data to make smart decisions. Airlines, governments, and tourism boards need to know what popular destinations are, when demand peaks, and how preferences shift. This project tackles those questions using long-term data.

---

## Objective of the Project

I had three goals:
- Firstly, to identify the most visited international destinations by U.S. travelers  
- Analyze seasonal, monthly, and weekly travel patterns  
- Create an Excel dashboard with clear insights and recommendations  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

I did everything in **Microsoft Excel** using:
- Power Query for cleaning  
- Pivot tables for analysis  
- Charts and slicers for visual storytelling  
- Custom formatting for a professional dashboard look  

---

## Project Scope

- Focused only on international destinations  
- Looked at trends by year, quarter, month, and day of the week  
- Did not include spending, demographics, or domestic travel  

---

## Data Collection & Integration

The data came from official U.S. government travel records. I cleaned and integrated the files using Power Query, aligned timeframes, and ensured naming consistency across all destinations.

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

I dealt with:
- Inconsistent destination names  
- Missing monthly values  
- Outliers caused by events like 9/11 and COVID
- I added flags for estimated data and built validation checks to ensure reliability.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Some standout findings:
- Canada and Mexico dominate as top destinations  
- Travel peaks in **July and August**  
- Sundays are the most popular departure day  
- The top 3 countries account for a huge share of total trips  

---

## Data Visualization

I built an Excel dashboard with:
- KPIs (total passengers, avg monthly traffic, etc.)  
- Charts for top destinations, seasonal trends, and day-of-week performance  
- Filters and slicers so users can explore the data themselves  

---

## Insights & Interpretation

- **Proximity matters**: Canada and Mexico had the most trips  
- **Summer is king**: July and August are high-volume months  
- **Weekend departures dominate**: Sundays were top travel days  
- **Latin America is rising**: Destinations like Colombia are gaining ground  

---

## Recommendations

- Airlines should expand capacity for **Sundays and summer months**  
- Travel marketers can target **Latin American growth markets**  
- Governments should improve border management during peak periods  
- Tourism boards can use this data to plan **seasonal campaigns**  

---

## Conclusion

This was a deep dive into long-term U.S. travel behavior, and I loved working on it. I turned decades of raw data into actionable insights, all using Excel. This project helped me improve my data storytelling, dashboard design, and ability to connect data to business decisions.
